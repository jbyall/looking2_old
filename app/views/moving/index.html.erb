<h3>Washer &amp Dryer</h3>
<p>Both are electric. We purchased them used and have been using them for 2 years, but have had no problems. The one issue is a missing plastic knob on the washer. A smaller piece of the knob is still there, so it is still pretty easy (and safe) to turn. It may be possible to find a replacement knob, but we have been using it like this for 2 years.</p>
<br>
<p><b>There has been a lot of expressed interest in these, but no takers yet.</b></p>
<p><b>Price: $150 each</b></p>
